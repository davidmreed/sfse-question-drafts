How do I start writing my first unit test? / How do I unit test this code? / Will you write my unit test?
These questions come up all the time and I personally would love to have a canonical deflection for them to try to stem downvotes, negative interactions, and frustration for the community (myself included).

A good canonical answer could collect our favorite resources for writing unit tests (How to Write Good Unit Tests, Trailhead, and the Developer Blog's Month of Testing series are among my favorites). It would try to be a succinct clearinghouse of where to go to get started, not a treatise, and would emphasize that most code is not "special" in the sense of requiring unique techniques to test. Lastly, it would mention in passing the importance of assertions and that unit tests are more than a vehicle to obtain code coverage.
