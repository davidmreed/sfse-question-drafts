How is code coverage obtained and calculated? / How do I increase my coverage? / Why can't I cover these lines?
A good canonical answer to these types of question might both link to the first canonical answer above to surface resources, while emphasizing a few points around coverage:

Coverage is a byproduct of writing high quality unit tests.

Briefly summarize common mistakes that cause control structures (loops and condition bodies) not to be covered (mismatched test data).
